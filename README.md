# Algorithms Challenge 2 - Sudoku Solutions

Write a function that solves any sudoku puzzle that can be solved. If there is no solution, the function simply raises an exception or throws an error with the message “No solution found”. If you've never played sudoku before, it might help to solve a few to get the hang of the process. You can do so at [https://sudoku.net/en](https://sudoku.net/en). You're not expected to generate
any images but simply solve the problem with the data structures you'd have chosen to model a puzzle.
